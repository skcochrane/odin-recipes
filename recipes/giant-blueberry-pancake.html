    <h2>Description</h2>

      The perfect brunch dish! This giant, no-flip blueberry cornmeal pancake
      will feed a crowd without needing to stand over the griddle flipping
      pancakes.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup All Purpose Flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cup Cornmeal</li>
      <li>2 Large Eggs</li>
      <li>1/4 cup Sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon Ground Cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Baking Powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon Baking Soda</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cup Buttermilk</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Butter, melted, divided</li>
      <li>1 cup Frozen Wild Blueberries, thawed and drained</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Canola Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375Â°F.</li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, beat together eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon,
        baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk until eggs are lightened and
        mixture is smooth, at least 30 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add corn meal and mix until well combined. Then add buttermilk and mix
        again until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add flour and mix until barely combined. There will still be lumps. Add
        2 tablespoons of melted butter and half of the blueberries stirring
        until just combined. Still, lumps are okay.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat canola oil and remaining butter in an 8-inch oven-safe nonstick or
        cast iron skillet on the stove over medium-high heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the butter/oil mixture is hot, gently add the pancake batter to the
        skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes. The pancake will still be very wet and
        look uncooked most of the way through, but you should see a little bit
        of golden brown forming on the outer edges.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle the remaining blueberries evenly over the top of the pancake
        and carefully transfer the skillet to the preheated oven. Bake until
        pancake is set and cooked through. You can test the center with a
        toothpick to make sure it comes out clean. This will take 10-15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the pancake from the oven and carefully invert onto a large plate
        or platter. Cut into wedges.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy topped with room-temperature butter and maple syrup.</li>
