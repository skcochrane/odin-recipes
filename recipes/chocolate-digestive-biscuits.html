    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 stick Butter, chilled and cut into pieces</li>
      <li>1/2 cup Ground, Toasted Almonds</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Brown Sugar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons White Sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Baking Powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Kosher Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon Ground Cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 1/3 cup Whole Wheat Flour, plus more for dusting work surface</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Cocoa Powder</li>
      <li>1/4 cup Milk</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon Vanilla Extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a food processor, combine all ingredients except milk and vanilla
        extract, processing until butter virtually disappears and you are left
        with a fine, floury meal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add milk and vanilla extract, pulsing until a damp, crumbly dough forms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and gently knead just
        to bring the dough together into a ball. Flatten the ball into a disk
        and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375Â°F.</li>
      <li>
        Remove dough disk from refrigerator and place between two pieces of
        floured parchment paper. Roll out dough until just shy of 1/4 inch
        thick. Lightly flour a 2-inch round cookie cutter and punch out cookies,
        dusting with more flour as needed to avoid sticking. Using a pastry
        brush, lightly brush off any excess flour from the cut cookie dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a spatula, carefully transfer the dough rounds to parchment-lined
        baking sheets. Gently knead the scraps of dough, reroll, and cut more
        cookies until all the dough is used.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prick each cookie three times with a fork and bake until the bottoms and
        edges are browned, 15-18 minutes. Let cookies cool on baking sheets,
        they will continue to crisp as they cool. Let cookies cool completely to
        room temperature before storing in an air-tight container.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enjoy with a cup of coffee or tea, as part of a s'more, or as a
        standalone snack.
